This is not (yet) an official C++ client library for the [IOTA Reference Implementation (IRI)](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri).

It implements both the [official API](https://iota.readme.io/docs/getting-started), as well as [newly proposed features](https://github.com/iotaledger/wiki/blob/master/api-proposal.md#proposed-api-calls).
